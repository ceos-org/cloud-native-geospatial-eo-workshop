    "# Measuring Land Productivity with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2: A Cloud Native Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The cloud native geospatial paradigm has the potential to make Earth observation analysis accessible to more people, more easily.\n",
    "In the simplest terms, instead of downloading data before performing an analysis, it’s now possible to stream data directly from the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the steps required to query and load NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data using a Spatio-Temportal Asset Catalog (STAC), and how to use that data to investigate land productivity.\n",
    "Importantly, the benefit of using a cloud native approach is that there is no requirement to download and process individual scenes. \n",
    "Instead, a query is used to identify the relevant scenes, and then software is used to only load a relevant portion of those scenes into the computer's memory. \n",
    "\n",

    "The relevant indicator is 15.3.1: \"Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area\", which has three sub-indicators: trends in land cover, trends in land productivity or functioning, and trends in carbon stocks above and below ground. \n",

    "\n",
    "The next steps from here would be to identify whether there is a statistically significant trend in the annual maximum EVI2 values, which could then be classified as the land becoming degraded or not degraded. This would then feed into SDG indicator 15.3.1 along with measures on land cover and carbon stocks to produce an overall assessment of the amount of degraded area as a proporition of the total area. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a user of this notebook, you may like to:\n",
    "1. Identify a new area of interest and re-run the analysis\n",
    "2. Extend the analysis to fit a trend line to the EVI2 over time\n",
